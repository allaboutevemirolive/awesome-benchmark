Below is the query I have been using. How do I type if I want the query to be the latest date?


lifetime parameter rust site: stackoverflow.com

To include the latest date in your search query, you can make use of the time-sensitive search feature provided by Google. Here's an example of how you can modify your query to include the latest date:

```text
lifetime parameter rust site:stackoverflow.com after:YYYY-MM-DD
```

Replace `YYYY-MM-DD` with the desired date in the format of year, month, and day. For example, if you want to include results from after July 1, 2023, you can use:

```text
lifetime parameter rust site:stackoverflow.com after:2023-07-01
```

By including the `after:` operator followed by the date, you are instructing Google to only show results from after the specified date. This can help you filter out older discussions and focus on more recent information.

Note: The date format must be in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format, and make sure not to leave any spaces between the colon and the date.

Keep in mind that this method relies on Google's indexing of pages, so the results might not be perfectly up-to-date.
