> Besides "site:" and "after:", what else should I know?


In addition to the "site:" and "after:" operators, there are a few more search operators and techniques that can be helpful when searching on Google. Here are a few:

## 1. "before:" operator: 

Similar to the "after:" operator, you can use the "before:" operator to search for results from before a specific date. For example, "lifetime parameter rust site:stackoverflow.com before:2023-07-01" will show results from before July 1, 2023.

## 2. "filetype:" operator: 

If you are looking for specific file types, you can use the "filetype:" operator. For example, searching for "Python tutorials filetype:pdf" will return search results containing PDF files related to Python tutorials.

## 3. "intitle:" operator: 

This operator allows you to search for specific terms in the title of a webpage. For instance, "intitle:Python beginners guide" will show results where the title includes the phrase "Python beginners guide."

## 4. "related:" operator: 

If you come across a helpful webpage and want to find similar pages, you can use the "related:" operator. For example, "related:python.org" will display websites related to Python.org.

## 5. Synonyms: 

Using a tilde (~) before a search term will include synonyms in the search results. For example, searching for "~programming languages" will return results related to programming languages and their synonyms.

## 6. Verbatim search: 

By enclosing your search query in double quotation marks, you can perform a verbatim search. This ensures that Google searches for the exact phrase you specified, without any automatic corrections or additions.

## 7. Wildcards: 

You can use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard within a search query. For example, searching for "machine learning * techniques" will return results with various phrases like "machine learning advanced techniques" or "machine learning optimization techniques."

## 8. Excluding terms: 

If you want to exclude certain terms from your search results, you can use the minus (-) sign. For instance, searching for "Python tutorials -beginners" will exclude results containing the word "beginners."

## 9. Cached pages: 

If you're looking for a webpage that may have been recently updated or removed, you can view a cached version of it by clicking on the small downward-pointing arrow next to the search result and selecting the "Cached" option.

Remember that these operators and techniques can be combined and customized to refine your search and get more accurate results based on your specific needs.
